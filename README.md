# INBIO Ontology

This repository is used to summarize and report the methodology and results of "INBIO: An Ontology for Argumentation in Invasion
Biology". This study will be submitted to  23rd International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW2022) (https://ekaw2022.inf.unibz.it/): Poster and Demo track.

In [INAS project](https://inas-argumentation.github.io/), we aim to develop an argumentation machine that supports the end users (especially young scientists) during the argumentation process in the invasion biology domain. To this end, 
we focus on a particular phase of scientific argumentation process, namely the development of claims (hypotheses). A core step to achieve this goal is the formal and semantic representation of claim statements (hypotheses). The \textit{INBIO} ontology is considered a first outcome. In this poster paper, we introduce the overview design and description of the new ontology

# Repository folders
This repository includes almost the material related to the development of the INBIO ontology. It includes the following:
* Original hypotheses; this foloder includes the source set of [twelves hypotheses](https://github.com/fusion-jena/INBIO/tree/main/original%20hypotheses) as well as a number of hand crafted trial to develop the ontology
* OntologyTerms; this folder includes the set of extracted terms from the input hypotheses along with the set of ontologies from [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org/) containing these terms.

* The code folder has the [termSerach]([https://github.com/fusionjena/HoH_Core_Ontology/tree/master/code/code%20python%20search%20terms](https://github.com/fusion-jena/INBIO/tree/main/code)) source code used to lookup which ontologies from BioPortal containing the set of terms as well as the [module extractor]([https://github.com/fusion-jena/HoH_Core_Ontology/tree/master/code/ModuleExtractor](https://github.com/fusion-jena/INBIO/tree/main/code/ModuleExtractor))  used to extract a module from the the selected ontology 
* The preliminary outcome of the ontology deveoplemnt is stored in the [ontology]([https://github.com/fusion-jena/HoH_Core_Ontology/tree/master/ontologyHoH](https://github.com/fusion-jena/INBIO/tree/main/ontology)) folder.
